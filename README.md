# Protohackers in Elixir

This is my implementation of the [protohackers](https://protohackers.com/) problems.

## Problem00: Smoke Test

Implement a basic echo server.

## Problem01: Prime Time

- Use Jason to parse json.
- `packet: :line` is really helpful.

## Problem02: Means to an End

Need to implement a basic data structure to help do the calculation.

## Problem03: Budget Chat

Using Elixir/Erlang to implement a chat server is so easy! And binary pattern matching is awesome!
